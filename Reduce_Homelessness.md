# Overview
Reduce Homelessness in the US by de-centralizing sleep solutions, moving from in private citizen's houses to out in the world.

# Purpose
+ Provide poor people efficient ways to harness their critical thinking skills
+ Modernize daily life to the 21st century
+ Reduce waste and human suffering

# Implementation
+ Public beds will be placed in public places such as coffee shops, transit centers, and public schools
+ Anybody is free to utilize them as "temporary" "housing" to rest, shower, and eat free food
+ All paid for by the government, and the plan is budget neutral because of investments into clean energy in the new "housing" "units"
+ This will remove the issue of homelessness and cause a great deal of economic momentum to occur
