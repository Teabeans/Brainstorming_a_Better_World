# Overview
Every year, a very large majority of electricity goes to waste. This could be easily solved through the use of open source monitoring software/hardware installed in every US home.

# Purpose
+ Decrease power use inefficiency
+ As power is a limited commodity, this would be a massive improvement in quality of life for most.
+ Stimulate economy through money saved, and economic activity generated by development of the monitoring solution

# Implementation
+ Raspberry Pi and breadboard based hardware solution that is installed at the breaker box of every US home. It provides the hardware capability to monitor power consumption
+ Software running on the Raspberry Pi will connect to an app on the user's smartphone, which will use push notifications to request approval for any power draw from the grid. The raspberry pi will have a 4G LTE connection to ensure stable data transfer.
+ This will remove all inefficiencies of power draw as the user will be in charge.
